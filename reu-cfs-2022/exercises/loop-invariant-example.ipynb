    "__General Idea__\n",
    "\n",
    "At a particular place in the program, you claim that certain things about your data are true. These are called _assertions_.\n",
    "\n",
    "If these assertions are crafty slyly, your programming is like hopping from assertion to assertion, guiding the data transformation from a somewhat unknown starting state to a perfectly known, correct, end state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, from a list of numbers of unknown order to a sorted list of those same numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pre and post conditions__\n",
    "\n",
    "Some wise places to put assertions are at the beginning and ending of procedures. Those at the beginning are the pre-conditions &mdash; those things which are true of the data you received; those at the ending are the post-conditions &mdash; the now certainly true things about the data, the goal of the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Loop invariants__\n",
    "\n",
    "The other wise place is at the entry to a loop, and at the bottom of the loop. They are always true but are true in a wider and wider scope. At first the asserts are true of just a small part of your data, but each time through the loop that part enlarges. The loop ends when the assertion covers all the data.\n",

    "L.I. (1) we have something larger than all so far\n",

It is generally impossiple to get a perfect LI; or it is overwhelming in effort. And unneeded. Things can have too little salt, but they can also have too much salt. And it's a matter of taste. \n",
