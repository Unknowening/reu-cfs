    "The novelty of Python syntax is that it uses indentation to express logical structure. Many languages are very tolerate of white space, and the layout of a program is dictated by what the community feels provides the best readablity. But the computer does not care about that layout. In Python, layout and program structure are one.\n",

Without the semicolon the value returned by the statement is printed; with, that verbosity is suppressed.\n",

Only the triple quoted literal notation can span lines, and the newlines are literally part of the strings.
